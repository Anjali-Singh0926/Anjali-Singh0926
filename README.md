## 👋 Hello, I'm Anjali Singh

I am currently pursuing **B. Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** (Batch 2026), and I aspire to become a **Data Scientist / Data Analyst**.  
My passion lies in the intersection of **data** and **intelligence** — using AI, machine learning, and generative models to extract insights, build predictive systems, and visualize data in meaningful ways.

### 🎯 What I'm Focused On
- **Artificial Intelligence & Generative AI**: exploring models, prompt engineering, and downstream applications  
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: classification, regression, computer vision, NLP, etc.  
- **Data Science & Analytics**: cleaning, exploring, modeling, deriving insights  
- **Data Visualization**: telling stories through charts, dashboards (Power BI, matplotlib, etc.)

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL  
- **Libraries / Frameworks**: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn, maybe Hugging Face  
- **Visualization / BI Tools**: Power BI, Tableau, Plotly  
- **Others**: Git, APIs, Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code

### 📚 What I'm Learning / Working On
- Deep Learning architectures and transformers  
- Generative AI / prompt engineering  
- Real-world projects combining AI + analytics  
- Improving visual storytelling with complex datasets
