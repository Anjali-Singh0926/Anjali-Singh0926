Hi, I'm Anjali Singh, a B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at JB Institute of Technology, Dehradun (Batch 2026).

My goal is to become a Data Scientist or Data Analyst, using data-driven insights to solve real-world problems.

I’m deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization — I love exploring how intelligent systems can understand and create data in new ways.

Currently, I’m learning more about Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and data analytics tools, such as Power BI and Python libraries.

I enjoy working on projects that combine data, AI, and creativity to build meaningful solutions.

Feel free to connect with me: anjalisingh4mnorth@gmail.com
